      <p>"There is a part of me that's deeper than my heart and soul where she resided, a part missing that I'll never get back.  It's the infinite space that a mother takes up that becomes a black hole when she's gone.  After time, it stops spreading, it stops eating the stars within you, but it's still there.  Just this black, hungry pit that makes you ache to your bones with loss."

          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>My mom grew up in Ridley Park, PA, along with three brothers, a sister, and countless pets. Her childhood summers were spent at the beach, as her parents would pack up the family and head to the shore. The beach became a significant part of her family's life, and this tradition was passed down to the next generation.</p>
          
          <p>Despite growing up with limited resources, my mom's family always had open arms for others. This welcoming trait became a defining feature of my mom's personality that she carried with her throughout her life.</p>

          <h2> Memories of a Wonderful and Caring Mother</h2>
          <p>My mom was a fantastic and caring person who always made time for me. She would play with me, help me practice whatever sport I was attempting, or cuddle up with me on the couch. I remember the many pranks we pulled on our neighbors, all her idea. She even taught me how to play "Ding Dong Ditch." Everyone who met her loved her, including all the kids in the neighborhood, whom she could always convince to play a round of "Kick the Can."</p>
          
          <p>My mom was always joking around, and her beautiful smile would take people's breath away. She embraced joy and laughter throughout her entire life.</p>

            <h2>My Mom's Battle with Breast Cancer</h2></summary>
            <p>In 2012, my mom lost her life after a long struggle with Breast Cancer. She was first diagnosed when I turned 13, and although she went into remission for a bit, the cancer returned and spread throughout her body. She fought with all her might to stay with me, trying everything from chemo to radiation and experimental treatments. I will always be grateful for the amount of fight she put up.</p>

            <p>Despite her passing, my mom's teachings stayed with me. She taught me to fight for what I want, and I will continue to do that for the rest of my life. I love and miss her, and I hope she is proud of who I have become as a person and the way my life has turned out.</p>
