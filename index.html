    <p>My mom was a beautiful woman, inside and out.  She loved nothing more than spending time with family, and always put a smile on other's faces.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Nancy grew up in Ridley Park, PA along with three brothers and a sister, as well as countless pets.  During the summer my grandparents would pack the kids up and bring them down the shore.  The beach grew to hold a special place in my family's lives, and that tradition was passed down to the next generation as well.</p>
  
      <p>Growing up, my mom's family did not have a lot, but they were always willing to welcome others with open arms.  This is a trait that my mom carried with her throughout her life.</p>
      
      <h2> Later On</h2>
      <p>My mom was a wonderful and caring person.  She always made time to play with me, practice whatever sport I was attempting, or just cuddle up on the couch together.  I have many memories of pranking the neighbors growing up, which was all her idea.  She was the one who taught me what "Ding Dong Ditch" was.  Everyone who met her loved her, and that included all the kids in my neighborhood growing up, where she could <em>always</em> talk the kids, and their parents, into a neighborhood round of "Kick the Can."</p>
      <p> My mom always loved joking around, and had one of the most beautiful smiles that would take people's breath away.  She was an amazing woman who embraced joy and laighter throughout her entire life.</p>

      <h2>2012</h2>
      <p>In the year 2012, my mom's life was taken far too early, after a long struggle with Breast Cancer.  She was first diagnosed with Breast Cancer when I turned 13 years old, and went into remission for a bit.  A few years later, the cancer had returned, but this time it was spread throughout her body.  My mom faught like hell to stay with me, and I will always be grateful for the amound of fight she put up.  She tried everything, from chemo, to radiation, to experimental treatments, just to stay with me longer.  I love my mom and all she sacrificed for me, and I hope that she is proud of who I have become as a person, and also knows how happy I am with the way my life has turned out.
